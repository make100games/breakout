# Breakout
A simple version of Breakout written in my own, homegrown C++ and OpenGL-based game engine.

This project essentially consists of two parts: the game engine and the game itself. The engine is general purpose and does not make any assumptions about the game that is being made. The actual game is implemented by creating custom GameObjects, Scenes and Renderables.
